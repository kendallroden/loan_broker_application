    Each bank will vary its behavior by the following parameters:

    MIN_CREDIT_SCORE - the customer's minimum credit score required to receive a quote from this bank.
    MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT - the maximum amount the bank is willing to lend to a customer.
    BASE_RATE - the minimum rate the bank might give. The actual rate increases for a lower credit score and some randomness.
    BANK_ID - as the loan broker processes multiple responses, knowing which bank supplied the quote will be handy.
